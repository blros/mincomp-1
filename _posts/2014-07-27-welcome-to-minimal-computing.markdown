The GO::DH Minimal Computing Working Group kickstarted itself into life with a workshop on  July 8 at the [DH2014 conference](http://dh2014.org) in Lausanne, Switzerland. For more information about that workshop, please see the [GO::DH call for presentations](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/working-groups/minimal-computing/kickstart-workshop/).

We envision this web space as a place for thought pieces on minimal computing, examples and how-to pieces, listings of events and resources, and as a place to find collaborators. Please watch this space for further developments.
