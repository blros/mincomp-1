In general we can say that minimal computing is the application of [minimalist principles to computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_%28computing%29). In reality, though, minimal computing is in the eye of the beholder. A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) could be understood as an example of a minimalist piece of hardware because the creators reduced computing components to what they saw as a bare minimum to achieve simple tasks. The learning curve for using one, though, can be threatening to beginners, and therefore requires more than minimum effort. 

On a user interface, on the other hand, eliminating clutter (unnecessary buttons, distracting design, etc) can also be understood to be part of a minimalist approach, making it easier for users to engage. Google's success, for example, may be owed to the reduction of the search function to one box. In order to achieve this feat, though, we estimate that Google uses an enormous amount of code and data in the back end, needing enormous computing power in turn.

I prefer to define minimal computing around the question "What do we need?" If we do so, both the ease of use, the ease of creation, the reduction in computing usage—and by extension—electricity.
